    "Our first lab is to setup the environment for the course. We will be using Python for the course, and we will be using Jupyter Notebooks to write and run our code. We will also be using the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn. In this lab, we will install all the necessary software and libraries.\n",

    "- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) - Anaconda is a distribution of Python that comes with all the necessary libraries and software for data science. It is the recommended way to install Python for this course.\n",
    "- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Visual Studio Code is a lightweight code editor that is great for writing Python code. It has built-in support for Jupyter Notebooks and Python debugging.\n",

You will probably need to select the python kernel for this notebook by clicking the 'Select Kernel' button in the upper right corner of the notebook.  We need to use Python 3 for this course."
