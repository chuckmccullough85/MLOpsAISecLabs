    "In this lab, we’ll be covering the essential basics of core MLflow functionality associated with tracking training event data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll start by learning how to start a local MLflow Tracking server, how to access and view the MLflow UI, and move on to our first interactions with the Tracking server through the use of the MLflow Client.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lab content builds upon itself, culminating in successfully logging your first MLflow model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The topics in this lab cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Starting an MLflow Tracking Server (Optionally) and connecting to a Tracking Server\n",
    "- Exploring the MlflowClient API (briefly)\n",
    "- Understanding the Default Experiment\n",
    "- Searching for Experiments with the MLflow client API\n",
    "- Understanding the uses of tags and how to leverage them for model organization\n",
    "- Creating an Experiment that will contain our run (and our model)\n",

    "Using the MLflow Client API\n",
    "===========================\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section, we started an instance of the MLflow Tracking Server and the MLflow UI. For this stage, we’re going to be interfacing with the Tracking Server through one of the primary mechanisms that you will use when training ML models, the MlflowClient. For the duration of this lab, this client API will be your primary interface for MLflow’s tracking capabilities, enabling you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initiate a new Experiment.\n",

    "creating unique experiments for specific collections of runs offers\n",

    "\n",
    "**Benefits of Defining Unique Experiments:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1\\. **Enhanced Organization**: Experiments allow you to group related\n",
    "runs, making it easier to track and compare them. This is especially\n",
    "helpful when managing numerous runs, as in large-scale projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\. **Metadata Annotation**: Experiments can carry metadata that aids in\n",
    "organizing and associating runs with larger projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the scenario below: we're simulating participation in a large\n",
    "demand forecasting project. This project involves building forecasting\n",
    "models for various departments in a chain of grocery stores, each\n",
    "housing numerous products. Our focus here is the 'produce' department,\n",

    "\n",
    "**When Should You Define an Experiment?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The guiding principle for creating an experiment is the consistency of\n",
    "the input data. If multiple runs use the same input dataset (even if\n",
    "they utilize different portions of it), they logically belong to the\n",
    "same experiment. For other hierarchical categorizations, using tags is\n",
    "advisable.\n",
