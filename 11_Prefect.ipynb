    "How can we make this script schedulable, observable, resilient, and capable of running anywhere?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Install Prefect\n",
    "\n",
    "Prefect is published as a Python package. To install or upgrade an existing Prefect install, run the following command in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install -U prefect`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Connect to Prefect's API\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of Prefect's functionality is backed by an API. Sign up for a forever free Prefect Cloud account or accept your organization's invite to join their Prefect Cloud account.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new account or sign in at https://app.prefect.cloud/.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create `API Key` from prefect cloud:\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use the `prefect cloud login` CLI command to log in to Prefect Cloud from your environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "`prefect cloud login -k UPDATE_KEY_HERE `\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Turn your function into a Prefect flow\n",
    "\n",
    "The fastest way to get started with Prefect is to add a @flow decorator to your Python function. Flows are the core observable, deployable units in Prefect and are the primary entrypoint to orchestrated work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a python file `my_gh_workflow.py`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import httpx   # an HTTP client library and dependency of Prefect\n",
